#Livable Cities UW#
- - - 
##The Idea##
Over the last two years, leading minds at the University of Wisconsin-Madison have been discussing how to harness the full capacity of the University and direct it toward solving the world’s most pressing challenges. Right away, cities emerged as a potential theme to unite campus units and create impactful solutions. 

Today that group – which includes leaders of the University’s Global Health Institute, Wisconsin Energy Institute, Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies, Office of Sustainability and former Chancellor David Ward – is poised to embark on an integrated campaign to imagine, design and prototype the sustainable city of the future – the Livable City – and redefine its relationship with the landscape around it. 

##The Vision##
Livable Cities UW will serve as an incubator for developing, implementing, and promoting best practices to improve cities and the lives lived within them. An innovative and adaptive collaborative format – “studios” – will be used to coordinate efforts in a focused but flexible environment. Each studio will be centered on a theme of urban livability, and will engage a team of UW-Madison faculty and students, in partnership with local stakeholders. 

The studio framework integrates applied UW expertise and community interests into state-of-the-art knowledge creation and action. Each studio will generate fast-turnaround, measurable improvements in the livability and sustainability in participating cities, while empowering communities to design and build the cities of the 21st century.


##The Plan##
A Livable Cities Coordinating Council will propose studios, based on existing partnerships between UW-Madison faculty and communities, as well as emerging opportunities identified by the Council. 

Each studio will be geared toward addressing a suite of challenges and information needs identified by community leaders (e.g. Mayor, urban planning office, etc.)

Projects will be proposed for each studio that address that studio's core challenges, in cooperation with local partners. 

+ For each project, a funded team of on-site faculty and students serve as consultants to the community client.

+ Livable Cities will engage both graduate and undergraduate students offering site-based research opportunities akin to field work or study abroad. 

+ Outcomes from each project will be assessed for effectiveness and value, and progress/successes will be reported through press releases, social media, and community engagement events. 

+ Funding will support the establishment of on-site studios, faculty and student time, communications and outreach, and in-depth assessment of each project's process and outcomes. 


##Next##
To initiate this work, Livable Cities UW proposes expanding the following (3) projects using the studio framework:


###Local Motion – Active Transport in Cities ###
*Led by [Global Health Institute](http://ghi.wisc.edu/)*
>Several of the leading causes of disease and death are now lifestyle disorders and can be prevented or avoided by physical activity. The transportation systems of cities create opportunities and obstacles for regular physical activity. Jonathan Patz, the Director of UW’s Global Health Institute has long been a leader on the health co-benefits of mitigating climate change. GHI’s papers and presentations quantifying the impacts of active transport have been appeared in front of local, state, national, and international officials. The solutions from this studio can make cities more efficient, greener, and healthier at the same time. 

###Weather Ready Cities###
*Led by [Nelson Institute for Environmental Studies](http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/)*
>With a changing climate, extremes in weather are expected to become more intense and frequent. The infrastructure – for drinking water, wastewater management, energy supply and transportation – in most US cities is aging and ill suited to handle increasing demands placed on it by extreme events. US cities face a daunting but timely opportunity to lay the foundation for socially, economically and environmentally sustainable futures. This studio will combine the UW’s expertise in engineered and natural systems to produce attainable and appropriate infrastructure solutions for cities. Ensuring that the climate extremes of the future do not result in greater damages for cities and the people inhabiting them. 


###Feeding the City ###
*Led by [College of Agricultural and Life Sciences](http://www.cals.wisc.edu/)*
>Land grant institutions, like UW, were founded around improving agricultural practices. Today, that legacy is improving urban food systems. Ideas from this studio will be capable of increasing food production of urban space while improving equal access to nutritional food and strengthening communities to deal with other challenges they face. 

##Why UW, Why The Midwest?##
The University of Wisconsin-Madison is a nationally recognized, and comprehensive, public university located in the Midwest. While Livable Cities UW expects to produce innovations that can help cities around the world, the focus of the initiative will be urban areas in the Upper Midwest. UW’s location and connections to Midwestern cities make it well suited to addressing the specific challenges faced by cities in the region. Urban centers like Detroit and Milwaukee are engaged in uphill battles to become more livable: battles against unemployment, aging infrastructure, environmental quality, food insecurity and disenfranchisement. 

UW-Madison possesses the capacities to imagine and develop prototypical urban components, drawing on leading research in each of the following areas: infrastructure design and sustainability, innovation in dairy and cropping systems, investigations of public health under climate change conditions, research into sustainable energy systems, experiments in nutrient management in urban/agricultural watersheds, model programs in civic engagement, burgeoning citizen-science models, and a long record of leveraging the arts and humanities as transformative forces of public education. Few other institutions have expertise that is as comprehensive and intensive as we have on a single campus. 

Here at the University of Wisconsin-Madison we are exceptionally well positioned to address the most challenging quality-of-life issues of the 21st Century. Amidst a landscape of urban sustainability programs at US universities, Livable Cities UW will stand apart. The studio framework of Livable Cities directly connects world-class research with community needs to create practical knowledge and sustained action. These solutions will affect lives not only in the Midwest, but around world.
