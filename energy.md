#Urban Microgrids#

__1)	What is the PROBLEM? What are the major stakes of the problem/challenge; why does it number among the five most important problems in urban sustainability?__

>About 30% of household carbon (CO2) emissions in a Midwestern city such as Milwaukee stem from electricity use, while much of the remaining portion of emissions is due to driving (~50%), and home heating (~20%). ___Any significant reduction in urban CO2 emissions will have to include a reduction in electricity footprint.___ New energy technologies will not be practical without  new models of distributed energy storage and demand response strategies.  Such a transformation cannot occur without a serious change in consumer experience with electricity – what electricity is used for, when it is used, and how it is paid for. At present, consumer interactions with electrical systems are active (such as turning lights on and off), or passive (such as climate control systems), with a bill served at the end of each month. 

>___We envision energy ‘aware’ consumer experiences wherein information interfaces such as mobile phone and/or web interfaces are used for realizing end-use comfort with little or no additional effort.___ The information interface controls the power control backbone, and enables ‘smart’ operation of the power system to balance supply and demand with unprecedented levels of control. 

__2) 	What is a specific central challenge in this area that is yet unresolved?__

>Technically viabile solutions for integrating distributed generation and storage resources with the utility grid and automated demand response systems exist. They are called microgrids. ___The remaining central challenge is in integrating these technical solutions within the regulatory public utility paradigm.___  Prototype operational and business models for incorporating microgrids within the existing electricity infrastructure do not exist today. Discussions have been limited to issues narrowly focused on the economics of investment by various parties, and fail to harness the potential for the nuanced use of technology in realizing large-scale benefits. 

>Other possibilities for microgrids include 
>>utility-owned generation and storage assets in customer locations 
>>third party owned assets
>>third party operated systems
>>peer-to-peer energy exchanges
>>revenue settlement systems 
>>strategic role of price discrimination in limiting demand 
>>energy service businesses at the retail consumer level
>>e-commerce for electricity

>___The potential to reduce electricity demand via human mediation essentially remains untapped.___  A single, silver-bullet solution can not help realize the dramatic reductions in the electricity footprint necessary for resilience. An Urban Microgrid project will provide opportunities to explore solutions on the ground, and to develop demonstrations and narratives that support the transformation of the electricity infrastructure and consumer experience to realize overall GHG reduction.

__3) 	How does UW have a comparative advantage in this area/challenge relative to good work being done elsewhere (examples of work elsewhere welcome).__

>The University of Wisconsin-Madison is an established pioneer and leader in the area of microgrids research, development and technology transfer. At present, UW-Madison researchers are leading an NSF-funded effort to develop technologies for energy use reduction in buildings through ‘human mediation’. Among others, one of the inspirations for this work is the ‘_[NEST learning thermostat](https://nest.com/)_’ that saves customers about 20% in their energy bills, while providing a friendly and attractive user interface that improves user comfort levels. We have developed and tested an ‘_internet of electrical systems_’ that includes  ‘_learning lights_’ which can be integrated with building electrical systems. The system can provide smart energy services to manage supply, demand and storage at a granular level, while remaining friendly to the user and keeping track of complex revenue arrangements (such as e-commerce). For instance, the system can provide real-time arbitrage and scheduling among asynchronous loads (such as freezers or air-conditioners) in various homes to ensure base load capacity is managed effectively.

__4) 	If tasked with solving this specific challenge, what is the roadmap of steps that we would follow to address this problem (using a research/engagement model that has a "studio"-like component).__

>___A significant opportunity exists to create a ‘virtual utility’ within our community.___ The presence of campus cogeneration facility and district heating systems provide unique opportunities for developing integrated solutions. We will work with the stakeholders to identify a candidate for a prototype Urban Microgrid demonstration district within the UW-Madison campus and create a policy/legal/regulatory framework for deployment of an Urban Microgrid testbed. In parallel, we will scale up our technology hardware and software by partnering with technology vendors to deploy the system. We will then deploy the system in a phased manner, starting with a single building, technology retrofits, user enablement and proceed further with multiple buildings, distributed solar systems, distributed storage, and automated base-load management. We will collect data, conduct experiments, evaluate and disseminate results, and expand the scope of the project through continuing partnerships.

__5) anything else you might want to add that points to the urgency of the problem and our capacity to solve it.__
