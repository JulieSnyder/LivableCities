His document on the 'Pathways to Regional Sustainability' was comissioned as part of a $2 million HUD regional sustainability planning and implementation grant from the [federal Partnership for Sustainable Communities](http://urpl.wisc.edu/people/lagro/LaGro_CRSC%20Best%20Practices_final.pdf).

> __Chris has not been contacted directly about involvement in Livable Cities__, however, his projects as part of the [Yahara 2070](https://wsc.limnology.wisc.edu/yahara2070) relate to several aspects of Livable Cities. I am involved in an ancillary way with one project which examines [Madison's urban heat island](http://www.news.wisc.edu/23223). The projects highlights expertise in dense urban environmental monitoring networks. We are exploring the option of expanding such work to other cities and combining this data with health endpoints.

Mike helped the center create and administer a neighborhood survey of social capital indicators and was also on a grant proposal to assess the local food/nutrition environment. The Department of Community & Environmental Sociology could be an important resource for Livable Cities. __I do not believe he has been approached directly about Livable Cities.__
