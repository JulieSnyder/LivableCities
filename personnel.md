#Organizing Leadership#
### The [original 'white paper'](https://github.com/vargovargo/LivableCities/blob/master/LivableCitiesOriginal.md) informing this work was produced by the directors of 4 UW Institutes.###

+ [Jonathan Patz](http://ghi.wisc.edu/person-types/leadership/#5020) - [Global Health Institute](http://ghi.wisc.edu/)
> __Jonathan initially established contact with the most engaged donors for the initiative__. 'Livable Cities' is also one of the four priority areas for the Global Health Institute, which Jonathan directs. GHI has received small gifts to pursue the development of this initiative and fund an internal (UW) grant process around Livable Cities. 

+ [Paul Robbins](http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/director.php) - [Director, Nelson Institute](http://www.nelson.wisc.edu/index.php)
> During Jonathan's sabbatical, __Paul has assumed a primary leadership role in guiding the discussion with donors__. 

+ [Craig Benson](http://sustainability.wisc.edu/about/leadership/craig-benson/) - [Office of Sustainability](http://sustainability.wisc.edu/)
> Craig has been involved in some of the first larger meetings around Livable Cities, including helping to craft the initiatl idea.  In the most recent meetings with the interested donor, he hasn't been engaged. 

+ [Mike Corradini](http://energy.wisc.edu/about/energy-experts/michael-corradini) - [Wisconsin Energy Institute](http://energy.wisc.edu/)
> Mike was at the August Livalble Cities meeting with David Ward. Mary Blanchard is the primary person who would be working on the initiative.

+ [Tracey Holloway](http://www.sage.wisc.edu/people/holloway/holloway.html) - [SAGE - Nelson](http://www.sage.wisc.edu/) - ___transportation, air quality, computational modeling___
> __Tracey has been a consistent member of the leadership behind this initiative__. She, along with Paul, have been the most important in developing the Livable Cities work in the past 3 months. She has been in direct contact with engaged donors.

+ [Deb Holt](http://www.supportuw.org/contact-us/directory/?empid=Emp00082) - [UW Foundation](http://www.supportuw.org/)
> __Deb is  primary contact between the UW (Foundation) and engaged donors__. She has been actively engaged in the conversations internally, with donors, and other external partners regarding the direction and timing of the initiative. Among several important leads, Deb has fostered connections to the [UW Arts Institute](http://www.arts.wisc.edu/artsinstitute/) and local arts community to think about opportunities for Livable Cities to engage and embrace the arts. 

+ [Joel Rogers](http://www.cows.org/staff-page/joel-rogers) - [Center on Wisconsin Strategy (COWS)](http://www.cows.org/)
> __Joel has only recently been engaged by Livable Cities leadership.__ He and COWS' experience and connections to political leaders and municipal administrators – as well as their perspective on urban process and change – is invaluable to the Initiative. Joel was introduced to Livable Cities through Tracey when they worked together on the EPA ACES grant proposal.  Julie Snyder invited him to attend DMI Dinner in November 2014. Jason, Deb, and Julie followed up with Joel for breakfast on December 1, 2014.

His document on the 'Pathways to Regional Sustainability' was commissioned as part of a $2 million HUD regional sustainability planning and implementation grant from the [federal Partnership for Sustainable Communities](http://urpl.wisc.edu/people/lagro/LaGro_CRSC%20Best%20Practices_final.pdf). The document outlines priorities for Madison's Capital Region. Jim is an important contact for thinking about operationalizing sustainability metrics for communities. He has studied and developed theories of change in the built and social environments of cities. 

+ [Satya Rhodes-Conway](http://www.cows.org/staff-page/satya-rhodes-conway) - [Center of Wisconsin Strategy](http://www.cows.org/)

* [Giri Venkataraman](http://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/venkataramanan_giri) - 
> He is on sabbatical until fall 2015. He has been one of the most eager faculty members to sit down and discuss potential new projects to come out of Jason's connections outside the university. He has been very responsive providing narrative in planning stages for donors.  He works on microgrids and energy.  Giri has come to meetings with Jason and others at the city about performing experiments on city buildings, such as the Monroe Street library, discussions about using private buildings as research sites (like apartment buildings such as McGrath Properties). These research sites help building ownders understand utility use.  Also some discussion on developing apps on air quality, which has led to further conversations with other faculty members like Kristin Malecki.
+ [Brian Christens](http://sohe.wisc.edu/staff/brian-christens/) - [School of Human Ecology](https://sohe.wisc.edu/) - ___collective impact, community engagement___
> Brian is the Faculty Director of UW's [Center for Community & Nonprofit Studies (The CommNS)](http://sohe.wisc.edu/who-we-are/centers/uw-center-for-nonprofits/). He and his team are very interested in helping achieve lasting improvements and changes in cites by empowering and enabling communities. I met with him and his post-doc __________________ in Dec. 2014 and discussed drafting proposals for specific funding of his type or work for potential donors - alternatively, he could be involved with teams funding under the LC 'matching strategy'.


+ [Steve Ventura](http://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/727) - [Soil Science](http://soils.wisc.edu/)
> Steve has been contacted on multiple occassions by Jason and Tracey.  Tracey approached him in December 2014 about leading the food Livable Cities group sometime in early 2015.  Steve has agreed.  Steve has many connections to CALS and food systems work in Milwaukee.  He is a founder in the Institute for Urban Agriculture and Nutrition.

>Jason and Tracey have both spoken to Greg about Livable Cities. His work on energy will be directly relatable. He doesn't lead LaFollette workshops, as we previously thought.

+ [Chris Kucharik](http://www.sage.wisc.edu/people/kucharik/kucharik.html) - [SAGE - Nelson](http://www.sage.wisc.edu/)
> __Chris has not been contacted directly about involvement in Livable Cities__, however, his projects as part of the [Yahara 2070](https://wsc.limnology.wisc.edu/yahara2070) relate to several aspects of Livable Cities. I am involved in an ancillary way with one project which examines [Madison's urban heat island](http://www.news.wisc.edu/23223). The projects highlights expertise in dense urban environmental monitoring networks. We are exploring the option of expanding such work to other cities and combining this data with health endpoints. 

+ [Michael Bell](http://dces.wisc.edu/people/faculty/michael-bell/) - [Community & Environmental Sociology](http://dces.wisc.edu/) - ___food systems, social capital___

Mike helped the center create and administer a neighborhood survey of social capital indicators and was also on a grant proposal to assess the local food/nutrition environment.

Susan mentioned the La Follete workshops, a graduate school requirement.  Five or six students spend a semester to develop a report for a client (municipal departments, such as waste management in Milwaukee). They are always looking for new projects with real world clients each semester. 

+ [Donald Moynihan](http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/donald-moynihan) - [La Follette School of Public Affairs](http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/index.php)
