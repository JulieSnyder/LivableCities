##Vision##
Our goal is make the University of Wisconsin an international destination for science, scholarship and outreach to create diverse, safe, healthy and just urban areas. With concepts and prototypes for cleaner air, water, soil and power, and economically, equitably, ecologically and culturally rich urban places, we want to offer practical systems and models that emerging cities around the world can adapt and adopt.

##The UW Urban Studio##
###University Rigor. Real Problems. Better Places. Fuller Lives.###
Universtiy of Wisconsin Livable Cities, through its ___Urban Studios___, aims to connect UW experts and students with local governments and communities around the places we live. Our goal is to produce solutions that serve as models for improving lives in for people in cities around the world.  

Cities are now the dominant human habitat on Earth. Activities within their administrative boundaries affect places and people far beyond.  Thus urban innovation and solutions are needed to solve problems on the scales of local inequalities to global climate change. Impactful research and meaningful training require universities to work with cities, however, there is currently no good mechanism for directing the incredible faculty and student resources of the UW to study and work on these issues.  ___UW's Urban Studio___ will be a physical University space in the City of Madison where the _sectors_ of urban life convene. The Stuido is both a forum for stakeholders to collectively define urban issues and an incubator for creating solutions.

The five sectors and their expected outcomes are:

>__Citizen__

>_improved quality of life, health, opportunity, security_

>__Corporate__

>_discovery of new products, services, and markets_

>__Government__

>_improved policies and partnerships with citizens and businesses_

>__Service (non-profit)__

>_improved tools and designs for new programs and partnering communities_

>__University__

>_new research fronteirs and collaborations on and off campus_

##Project##
The Urban Studio would be conducted on annual basis with changing themes determined by the UW Livable Cities Coordinating Council. Each year the studio would concentrate on a theme of urban activity. Already, several themes have been identified for the first 5 years of operation.
