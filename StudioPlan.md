##Vision##

**Universtiy of Wisconsin Livable Cities**, through its Urban Studios, aims to connect UW experts and students with local governments and communities around the places in which we live. Our goal is producing solutions that serve as models for improving lives in for people in cities around the world.  

Cities are now the dominant human habitat and impact places and people far beyand their administrative boundaries.  Impactful research and meaingful trainging require involvement with urban places, however, there is currently no good mechanism for directing the incredible faculty and student resources of the UW to work and learn on these issues.  UW's Urban Studio will be a physical space in Madison serving as a forum for stakeholders to collectively define urban issues and as an incubator for creating solutions.

There are five sectors that come together through the Studio
>Citizen
Corporate 
Government
Service (non-profit)
University
