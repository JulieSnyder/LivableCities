#Food Systems 

Everyone eats, some more than others, some have healthier diets than others. In large cities, the others tend to be poor and minorities. Food security is an acute issue in cities, including food affordability, access, quality, and sustainability, each in relationship to community and public health and services.

Everyone eats, and food means trade. The production, processing, transportation, marketing, consumption, and waste management of food affects every other economic activity and every environmental system, particularly water, energy, land use, transportation, soil, and air. Reducing negative impacts and advancing resilience requires integrated and regional thinking.

Everyone eats, and according to complex and ever changing social and legal norms. The activities associated with food security and trade are worked out within existing social and legal contexts even as food system innovators are pushing at and reconstructing these legal and social contexts. In short, energy from the community is mixing with funding opportunities to produce economic, health, and legal/political changes that are giving us local food movements, urban and peri-urban agriculture, changes in production and processing methods for greater sustainability, and increased public awareness of food issues (with, to limited extent, concomitant behavior changes). 

__1) What are the major stakes of the problem/challenge; why does it number among the five most important problems in urban sustainability?__
> - food security (both access to sufficient amounts of food, and availability of healthy, affordable choices)
> - food awareness (education, social norms, skills), civic aspects and the relation between health and diet
> - food system sustainability, including robust business practices and legal tools supporting more efficient production, transportation, processing, and post-consumption waste management

>These are important for UW and Nelson Institute because they have huge impact on most human and environmental systems, are complex and dynamic, and are a fundamental to life as we know it.

__2) What is are specific central challenges in this area that are yet unresolved?__
>- locally appropriate public policy that integrates government and advances urban/regional food systems despite policies that support an “industrial” food system unable to address urban problems 
>- standard models of top-down research and technology transfer are not likely to be effective in resolving food security issues in city populations that have inherent distrust of authority

__3) How does UW have a comparative advantage in this area?__
>UW-Madison is a key leader in the development of the Institute for Urban Agriculture and Nutrition (IUAN) in Milwaukee. This is a unique collaboration between seven academic institutions, the City of Milwaukee, Growing Power Inc., and the Milwaukee Food Council representing numerous community organizations. Furthermore, the UW-Madison has numerous professionals engaged in this research.

__4) If tasked with solving this specific challenge, what is the roadmap of steps that we would follow to address this problem (using a research/engagement model that has a "studio"-like component).__
>The intention of IUAN is to develop a community-based research, outreach and educational agenda.  The process of developing and implementing this agenda will benefit from a strong voice representing environmental sciences and environmental ethics in discussions and activities. One clear pathway of activity will be to address pieces of the agenda through graduate practicums and undergraduate capstone courses (examples of such courses oriented to urban food systems are already underway in the Nelson Institute).
