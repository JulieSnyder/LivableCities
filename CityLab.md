###The next manifestation of [UW Livable Cities](LivableCitiesOriginal.md) and the previous [studio concept](StudioPlan.md)

Partnerships between university faculty and community stakeholders could be the key to changing cities for the better. Today these connections exist in piecemeal fashion and lack the funding mechanisms to institutionalize them in real ways. 

This example is common on campus. A local official runs into a faulty member at an event. This might lead to a follow up meeting and if the faculty member has a student to dedicate some time, the issues of the city/community may get some attention. After a semster, maybe two, the work is done. Despite the appreciation and need of the municipal leaders, the partnership may or may not pick up again with a new student or project. Big research proposals with dedicated community partnership components may not get funded because they are seen as too applied for funding from large scientific organizations (this was exactly the case with a recent UW proposal to the National Science Foundation around Weather Resilient Cities).

Two problems with this story must be resolved to create change for cities. First, the relationships between University and off-campus partners must be fostered in more permanent ways. Barriers in investment, communication, and organizational perceptions must be overcome to make this happen. And second, the work must spread throughout the university and can not be limited to a single department or student â€“ disciplinary must disappear.

The City Lab model places faculty and students from several departments in a common space off-campus. __The goal is to foster the exchange and development of information, values, and skill between the University of Wisconsin and cities.__  Each City Lab will take the existing connections between faculty and cities to inform the focus of the work.  Over the course of (a semester?) one year the space will be used in diverse ways to explore and prototype solutions for implementation. The result will be stronger partnerships bewteen the univeristy and city to produce richer solutions. 

_Each City Lab Year will require_
+ work/meeting space that is inviting to community memebers and that will, idealy, stimulate new collaborations. Locations should be within the city, but off-campus. 
+ 3-5 faculty fellows and 3 citizen scholars for dedicated time and presence on the projects - Buy out (5) faculty time @ 10% + fringe (_$120K_)
+ 1 new post-doc to push forward faculty/community ideas and generate new research frontiers + fringe (_$65K_)
+ 1 full-time communtiy-liason to help identify citizen scholars and promote events + fringe (_$70-$80K/yr_)
+ A new administrative manager dedicated to the operation and coordination of the Studio + fringe (_$70-$80K/yr_)
+ Two student hourlies for ~12hr/wk (_$15K/yr_)
+ Meeting Costs (_$30K/yr_)

##City Lab Madison##
__[Smart Growth](greeninf.md) - [Jim Lagro](http://www.wicci.wisc.edu/lagro.php) and [Capital Region Sustainable Communities](http://www.capitalregionscrpg.org/)__
>This work will build on a recent visioning process conducted by Lagro and the CRSC, which identified [ecosystem services](http://www.capitalregionscrpg.org/?page_id=1295) as one of five key areas to focus on ahead of future growth. [Projects}(http://www.capitalarearpc.org/FUDA.html) in Madison and surrounding communities to balance environmental quality and long-term growth are already underway and ready for the help of university resources. 

>The Madison City Lab has the chance to be part of a new redevelopment project which co-locates several private and non-profit environmental interests in the region. The Project is built on the success of the developer's first ['Green Exchange' in Chicago](http://www.greenexchange.com/). The Green Exchange model fosters relationships among our tenants and will create channels for Livable Cities to improve lives for people in cities around the world.  Early tenants include individual and organizations in renewable energy, sustainable buildings, clean tech, and green business.  It is a unique chance to kick off the City Lab in union with several parallel efforts across the region. 


##City Lab Milwaukee##
__[Food Systems](food.md) - [Steve Ventura](http://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/727) and [Institute for Urban Agriculture and Nutrition (IUAN)](https://www.facebook.com/InstituteUrbanAgNutrition/info)__
>Rust belt cities of the midwest, like Miwaukee, are becoming the hotbed of urban agriculture in the US. This City Lab build on the work of UW Madison on the development of the IUAN in Milwaukee. This is a unique collaboration between seven academic institutions, the City of Milwaukee, [Growing Power Inc.](http://www.growingpower.org/), and the [Milwaukee Food Council](http://www.milwaukeefoodcouncil.org/milwaukee_food_council/home.html) representing numerous community organizations. Furthermore, the UW-Madison has numerous professionals engaged in this research. Additionally, burgeoning connections to ogranizations like the [Center for Resilient Cities](http://www.resilientcities.org/) will expand the work to even more project sites and communities.
