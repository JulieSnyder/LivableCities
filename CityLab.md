###The next manifestation of [UW Livable Cities](LivableCitiesOriginal.md) and the previous [studio concept](StudioPlan.md)

Partnerships between university faculty and community stakeholders could be the key to changing cities for the better. Today these connections exist in piecemeal fashion and lack the funding mechanisms to institutionalize them in real ways. 

This example is common on campus. A local official runs into a faulty member at an event. This might lead to a follow up meeting and if the faculty member has a student to dedicate some time, the issues of the city/community may get some attention. After a semster, maybe two, the work is done. Despite the appreciation and need of the municipal leaders, the partnership may or may not pick up again with a new student or project. Big research proposals with dedicated community partnership components may not get funded because they are seen as too applied for funding from large scientific organizations (this was exactly the case with a recent UW proposal to the National Science Foundation around Weather Resilient Cities).

Two problems with this story must be resolved to create change for cities. First, the relationships between University and off-campus partners must be fostered in more permanent ways. Barriers in investment, communication, and organizational perceptions must be overcome to make this happen. And second, the work must spread throughout the university and can not be limited to a single department or student – disciplinary must disappear. 

------

The City Lab model places faculty and students from several departments in a common space off-campus. __The goal is to foster the exchange and development of information, values, and skill between the University of Wisconsin and cities.__  Each City Lab will take the existing connections between faculty and cities to inform the focus of the work.  Over the course of ___(a semester?)___ one year the space will be used in diverse ways to explore and prototype solutions for implementation. The result will be stronger partnerships bewteen the univeristy and city to produce richer solutions. 

_Each City Lab Year will require_
+ work/meeting space that is inviting to community memebers and that will, idealy, stimulate new collaborations. Locations should be within the city, but off-campus (_$36K - $60K/yr_)
+ 3-5 faculty fellows and 3 citizen scholars for dedicated time and presence on the projects - Buy out (5) faculty time @ 10% + fringe (_$120K_)
+ 1 new post-doc to push forward faculty/community ideas and generate new research frontiers + fringe (_$65K_)
+ 1 full-time communtiy-liaison to help identify citizen scholars and promote events + fringe (_$70-$80K/yr_)
+ A new administrative manager dedicated to the operation and coordination of the Studio + fringe (_$70-$80K/yr_)
+ Two student hourlies for ~12hr/wk (_$15K/yr_)
+ Meeting costs (_$30K/yr_)

##City Lab Madison (beginning Fall 2015)##
__[Smart Growth](greeninf.md) - [Jim Lagro](http://www.wicci.wisc.edu/lagro.php) and [Capital Region Sustainable Communities](http://www.capitalregionscrpg.org/)__
>This work will build on a recent visioning process conducted by Lagro and the CRSC, which identified [ecosystem services](http://www.capitalregionscrpg.org/?page_id=1295) as one of five key areas to focus on ahead of future growth. [Projects}(http://www.capitalarearpc.org/FUDA.html) in Madison and surrounding communities to balance environmental quality and long-term growth are already underway and ready for the help of university resources. 

>The Madison City Lab has the chance to be part of a new redevelopment project which co-locates several private and non-profit environmental interests in the region. The Project is built on the success of the developer's first ['Green Exchange' in Chicago](http://www.greenexchange.com/). The Green Exchange model fosters relationships among our tenants and will create channels for Livable Cities to improve lives for people in cities around the world.  Early tenants include individual and organizations in renewable energy, sustainable buildings, clean tech, and green business.  It is a unique chance to kick off the City Lab in union with several parallel efforts across the region. 


##City Lab Milwaukee (beginning Fall 2015)##
__[Food Systems](food.md) - [Steve Ventura](http://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/727) and [Institute for Urban Agriculture and Nutrition (IUAN)](https://www.facebook.com/InstituteUrbanAgNutrition/info)__
>Rust belt cities of the midwest, like Miwaukee, are becoming the hotbed of urban agriculture in the US. This City Lab build on the work of UW Madison on the development of the IUAN in Milwaukee. This is a unique collaboration between seven academic institutions, the City of Milwaukee, [Growing Power Inc.](http://www.growingpower.org/), and the [Milwaukee Food Council](http://www.milwaukeefoodcouncil.org/milwaukee_food_council/home.html) representing numerous community organizations. Furthermore, the UW-Madison has numerous professionals engaged in this research. Additionally, burgeoning connections to ogranizations like the [Center for Resilient Cities](http://www.resilientcities.org/) will expand the work to even more project sites and communities. 

##City Lab Phoenix (beginning Fall 2016)##
__[Transportation] - [Eric Sundquist](http://experts.news.wisc.edu/experts/727) and [State Smart Transportation Initiative](http://www.ssti.us/)__
>For many decades, transportation planning has assumed continued increases in automobile use. Now, in a major reversal, the average American is driving considerably less. [SSTI is already helping](http://www.ssti.us/2013/09/vmt-inflection-point-factors-affecting-21st-century-travel-ssti-2013/) cities and states change their thinking to make the most of this trend. UW resources like [The Mayor’s Innovation Project](http://www.mayorsinnovation.org/), based at UW’s [Center on Wisconsin Strategy](http://www.cows.org/) provides access to a network of leaders throughout the country from which to draw input and to promote successes. Their partnerships in Phoenix, AZ ___(and Boulder/Denver, CO?)___ make up the foundation for this Lab's success, and will likely be integral to the pursuing all City Lab ventures. 

##City Lab Boulder (beginning Fall 2017)##
__[Microgrids] - [Giri Venekataraman](http://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/venkataramanan_giri) and [Wisconsin Energy Institute]()__
>Any significant reduction in urban carbon emissions will have to include a reduction in electricity footprint. Technically viabile solutions for integrating distributed generation and storage resources with the utility grid and automated demand response systems exist. They are called microgrids. The remaining central challenge is in integrating these technical solutions within the regulatory public utility paradigm. UW's [Bob Lasseter](http://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/lasseter_robert) is an established pioneer and leader in the area of microgrids research, development and technology transfer. His work,[adopted in western states](http://www.news.wisc.edu/20470) and his involvement with the [Power Systems Engineering Research Center](www.pserc.org) in Arizona make expanding this work to many cities a real posibility. 

__[Extreme Weather Resilience] - [Tracey Holloway](http://www.sage.wisc.edu/people/holloway/holloway.html) and [NCAR Earth System Laboratory ___(?)___](http://www.nesl.ucar.edu/about)__
>Climate change affecting the scope and scale of natural hazards such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and winter storms. The [costs of these disasters are increasing](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series), and as urban areas continue to expand, the changes to these hazards will continue to impact more people every year unless communities begin to consider the future conditions. A major problem with the process that many communities use as a benchmark for increasing their resilience is a lack of considering the potential changes to future weather scenarios. Recent activites between UW and partners across the country ___(as part of the NSF proposal development?)___ provide inertia for UW to help cities on this issue. 

##City Lab Bahir Dar (beginning Summer 2016)##
__[Urban Growth in Emerging Economies] - [Jonanthan Patz](http://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/venkataramanan_giri) and [Bahir Dar University](http://www.bdu.edu.et/)__
>Much of the urban growth on the planet will take place in cities of less than 1 million people and all of the urban development in human histroy will be duplicated in the next century. Ethiopia is one of the world's least, but most rapidly, urbanizing countries. Partnerships between [UW's Global Health Institute](http://ghi.wisc.edu/ghi-in-action/bringing-the-whole-university-to-ethiopia/) and Bahir Dar University provide the basis for massive capacity building efforts around urban development, the environment, health. Emerging interests between the universitys' agrciultutral units provide fertile ground for years of collaboration on a number of topics.
