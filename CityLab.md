###The next manifestation of [UW Livable Cities](LivableCitiesOriginal.md) and the previous [studio concept](StudioPlan.md)

#Livable Cities: Linking Advanced Research with Real-World Decisions#

Advanced discovery and innovation offer exciting new pathways for healthy and sustainable cities, in Wisconsin, the US, and worldwide. The University of Wisconsin-Madison is a leader in applied research, with a long track record of partnerships with decision-makers and community stakeholders. 

Unfortunately, these connections are piecemeal rather than institutionalized - a single professor, for a few years.

Consider this common story. A local official meets a professor at an event and the two exchange information. This might lead to a follow-up meeting, and - in the best case - to donated time by the faculty member or a student. After a semester or two the initial work is done, and the student graduates, or the researcher moves on to new projects. Although often transformative, this type of research-to-practice is rarely funded by cash-strapped local governments, and is typically viewed as "too applied" for funding from large scientific organizations (this was exactly the case with a recent UW proposal to the National Science Foundation around Weather Resilient Cities).

_How can we change this story?_ __Stop relying on chance encounters to do good work. Institutionalize it.__

We propose a novel structure to place UW-Madison researchers and students on the ground in cities to __develop and maintain the connections__ necessary for positive change. UW representatives will be dispatched from Madison and embedded in urban laboratories - __"City Labs"__ - to convene with local citizens, organizations, governments, and businesses around specific topics related to urban sustainability. City Labs become the hubs of long-term collaboration and engagement by faculty, with staffing from junior faculty and students. 

--------

The City Lab model places faculty and students from several departments in a shared off-campus space. ___Like labs and centers on campus, this structure fosters the exchange and development of information, values, and skills between the University of Wisconsin and rapidly changing cities.___ Each City Lab will build on the existing connections between faculty and city partners to inform the focus of the work, while cultivating new relationships that would have been impossible previously. Over the course of each academic year, the space will be used to study problems and prototype solutions. During summers, workshops and visitor programs will ensure that host cities benefit from research and engagement of the global research community. The result will be cities that make decisions with advanced knowledge and research; students who have access to new issues and networks within Wisconsin and around the world; and researchers with support to produce relevant and adoptable solutions.

>The Madison City Lab has the chance to be part of a new redevelopment project which co-locates several private and non-profit environmental interests in the region. The project is built on the success of the developer's first ['Green Exchange' in Chicago](http://www.greenexchange.com/). The Green Exchange model fosters relationships among our tenants and will create channels for Livable Cities to improve lives for people in cities around the world.  Early tenants include companies and organizations working on renewable energy, sustainable buildings, clean tech, environmental policy, and green business.  It is a unique chance to kick off the City Lab in union with several parallel efforts across the region.

##City Lab [Buildings](buildingblocks.md)##
__Potential Location: Madison, WI  (beginning Fall 2016, in Partnership with Building Blocks at UCSC and MIT)__
>Existing structures are old and failing, money to repair and replace is scarce, and knowledge and political will to move forward in a more sustainable way is lacking. In this context, the Building Blocks Initiative employs advanced building technologies and big data to improve the sustainability of infrastructure and the built environment. In doing so, Building Blocks breaks down the barriers between urban systems (e.g. energy and water), buildings, and properties to promote increased sustainability, resilience, and community. Building Blocks emphasizes that projects serve as learning spaces for training and innovation – a necessary, but missing, component for facilitating the spread and adoption of sustainable practices.

##City Lab Transportation##
__Potential Location: Los Angeles, CA; Phoenix, AZ (beginning Fall 2016)
>For many decades, transportation planning has assumed continued increases in automobile use. Now, in a major reversal, the average American is driving considerably less. [SSTI is already helping](http://www.ssti.us/2013/09/vmt-inflection-point-factors-affecting-21st-century-travel-ssti-2013/) cities and states change their thinking to make the most of this trend. UW resources like [The Mayor’s Innovation Project](http://www.mayorsinnovation.org/), based at UW’s [Center on Wisconsin Strategy](http://www.cows.org/) provides access to a network of leaders throughout the country from which to draw input and to promote successes. Their partnerships in Phoenix, AZ and Boulder/Denver, CO make up the foundation for this Lab's success, and will likely be integral to the pursuing all City Lab ventures.

##City Lab [Energy](energy.md)##
__Potential Location: Boulder, CO; Sacramento, CA; Davis, CA; Palo Alto, CA (beginning Fall 2017)__
>Any significant reduction in urban carbon emissions will have to include a reduction in electricity footprint. Technically viable solutions for integrating distributed generation and storage resources with the utility grid and automated demand response systems exist. They are called microgrids. The remaining central challenge is in integrating these technical solutions within the regulatory public utility paradigm. UW's [Bob Lasseter](http://directory.engr.wisc.edu/ece/faculty/lasseter_robert) is an established pioneer and leader in the area of microgrids research, development and technology transfer. His work, [adopted in western states](http://www.news.wisc.edu/20470), and his involvement with the [Power Systems Engineering Research Center](www.pserc.org) in Arizona make expanding similar projects to many cities a real possibility. This effort also has application in developing countries (see [last activity below](https://github.com/vargovargo/LivableCities/blob/master/CityLab.md#city-lab-bahir-dar-beginning-summer-2016) with Professor Patz).

<!---we could partner with Grid Alternatives in our target city, which installs solar panels on low-income homes, in promotes diversity in the solar work force. Grid Alternatives has a range of programs for college students and recent grads, but has never had a formal partnership with a university. I've been in touch with their CEO and the director of their Spring Break program about developing a curriculum that integrates energy technology, energy policy, and social justice issues, and City Lab Energy could be the site of this program. That would be a very close connection between roof-top solar and our UW engagement)--->

_Potential Metrics_
+ per-capita energy consumption
+ CO2 emissions
+ roof-top solar systems installed 


##City Lab [Extreme Weather Resilience](weatherready.md)##
__Potential Location: New York City, NY; Boulder, CO (beginning Fall 2017)__
>Climate change is affecting the scope and scale of natural hazards such as hurricanes, tornadoes, and winter storms. The [costs of these disasters are increasing](http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series), and as urban areas continue to expand, the changes to these hazards will continue to impact more people every year unless communities begin to consider the future conditions. A major problem with the process that many communities use as a benchmark for increasing their resilience is a lack of considering the potential changes to future weather scenarios. Activities between UW and partners across the country were recently mobilized towards a highly competitive NSF proposal; while the proposal received excellent reviews, it was not funded; the extensive planning and preparation, however, provides substantial and timely inertia for UW to help cities on this issue.

##City Lab Urbanization##
__Potential Location: Bahir Dar, Ethiopia (beginning Summer 2018)__
>Much of the urban growth on the planet will take place in cities of less than 1 million people and all of the urban development in human history will be duplicated in the next century. Ethiopia is one of the world's least, but most rapidly, urbanizing countries. Partnerships between [UW's Global Health Institute](http://ghi.wisc.edu/ghi-in-action/bringing-the-whole-university-to-ethiopia/) and Bahir Dar University (BDU) provide the basis for massive capacity building efforts around urban development, the environment, and health. Emerging interests between BDU’s agricultural and engineering units provide fertile ground for years of collaboration on a number of topics.  The timing of a newly awarded USAID “Power Africa” grant to BDU (with UW’s School of Engineering and GHI as the US partners) to establish a microgrid power “Center of Excellence” along with professor Patz’s Fulbright Award to spend Spring, 2015, at BDU is opportune.
