#Livable Cities: Inspiring the University to Create Future-Ready Communities

*The University of Wisconsin-Madison is exceptionally well positioned to address the most challenging quality- of-life issues posed by a rapidly changing world at their nexus: the city.*

###Background:
For the first time in history, the majority of the world’s human population resides in urban settings. As global population continues to grow – expected to level off at nearly ten billion later this century – the world is becoming increasingly urbanized.   Cities are where people want to be increasingly.  From Seoul to San Francisco, and even in Madison, younger generations are moving back into cities rather than to the suburban settings as around the world, large urban areas are becoming megacities.  People are moving to cities to find employment, education, health care, arts and music and higher standards of living.  Our children or grandchildren will likely be residents of these new metropolitan areas.  
In the 21st Century cities will account for 90% of the global population growth, 80% of the CO2 emission, and 75% of all global energy use as well as water and food. The United Nations estimates that by 2050, almost three-quarters of the world’s population will live in cities.  

###Issues and Opportunities:
The majority of demographic and geographic changes are expected to occur in new urban settings around the world, especially, in emerging markets.  And yet, emerging cities around the world are being built using obsolete models invented in the 1950s and 1960s with separated functions and networks that connect the industrial, residential, and commercial enterprises. 

Problems vary between and within cities, particularly when comparing industrialized and developing countries.  Chronic diseases linked to sedentary lifestyles pose risks to Americans, whereas poor sanitary conditions, traffic-related injury, and exposure to vectorborne diseases dominate risks in poor countries.  Transitional economies must grapple with air and water pollution from unplanned industrial growth.  

Extreme weather patterns, driven by climate change, will stress urban infrastructure, strain the production and availability of food, water, energy and other resources, and challenge the delivery of public health and social services. Heavy air pollution, congested roadways, poverty, and public health problems are images commonly associated with megacities in the developing world.  Open space and biological diversity in exurban landscapes will also face increasing pressure as demand rises for living space and nutrition. This package of problems demands the study of livability and risk or benefits to health in diverse urban environments and will require smart, diverse solutions. 

The momentum of cities makes them crucial sites for implementing changes for effecting environmental impact, economic development, and political and social norms that improve equality.  The “Built Environment” is also a burgeoning area of focus in the field of public health, especially since the urban environment now dominates as the prototypical habitat in which humans live.   Cities are also key to sustainability since they define much of energy and resource utilization (or “ecological footprint”).  Human health and well being in cities depends upon social, economic, political, cultural and environmental determinants.  Urban design can influence many of these determinants, including energy flows and ecological footprints of cities; design also has directing effects on mental and physical health of urban dwellers.

We must see this inevitable shift toward urban expansion as an opportunity to catalyze emerging and evolving cities to leapfrog flawed systems and adapt to innovative holistic sustainable models that function optimally ecologically, economically, and equitably.  Our goal is to develop a delightfully diverse, safe, healthy and just world, with clean air, water, soil and power, economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed--systems and models emerging cities can adapt.

###Investments for the future: 
When costs are considered comprehensively --- both direct return on capital investment in the near term combined with the societal costs associated with unhealthy and unsustainable environments and disparity in opportunity --- investing in megacities that promote healthy and equitable lifestyles is the logical economic and social choice for society, even if the near term return on capital investment is less favorable or unfavorable.  However, we currently do not have the knowledge or tools to estimate comprehensive costs with confidence, the ability to articulate the impact of comprehensive costs effectively to the diverse constituencies in our society, or the ability to promote and shape policy where priority is placed on developing communities that are efficient, healthy, connected, and equitable.

With new and connected knowledge, we will help shape megacities that have the quality of life and the lifestyle that we envision for our children and grandchildren.  Interdisciplinary thinking and system-based approaches are needed to achieve this goal.  We must move away from a decoupled world where the true economic and social costs and consequences of developing, constructing, and living in our physical environment are ill defined, and move towards a world where we manage our society as coupled system for which we clearly understand the consequences of our choices and actions.  

###UW-Madison and the Future Communities:
UW-Madison is well positioned to meet these challenges in an integrated campaign to imagine, design and prototype the sustainable city of the future – the Livable City – and redefine its relationship with the landscape around it. 

UW-Madison’s location near growing metropolitan regions, including Madison, Milwaukee and Chicago, and its proximity to diverse agricultural, suburban and water-rich landscapes, makes it an ideal laboratory for the design of Livable City components and systems. The university possesses the capacities to imagine and develop prototypical urban components, drawing on leading research in infrastructure design and sustainability; innovation in dairy and cropping systems; investigations of public health under climate change conditions; research into sustainable energy systems; experiments in nutrient management in urban/agricultural watersheds; model programs in civic engagement; burgeoning citizen-science models; and a long record of leveraging the arts and humanities as transformative forces of public education. In addition, UW-Madison has well-established relationships with sectors deeply invested in coping with change, including industries such as, manufacturing, agriculture, real estate; non-governmental organizations; government from the local to international.

The prototype components and systems of adaptive cities can be developed and field-tested through partnerships with public, non-profit and corporate entities in locations where UW relationships already exist. A few examples of possible locations for development and proof-of-concept:

+ Detroit – urban food systems

+ Milwaukee – urban energy management and public health

+ Madison – urban/agricultural interface and watershed management

+ Chicago – green space and ecological restoration

UW-Madison has the opportunity to establish itself as a world leader in generating imaginative, flexible, sustainable and integrated components of Livable Cities that will deliver health, economic opportunity and a rich quality of life in a rapidly changing world.

###Clean Energy for the Livable City: Wisconsin Energy Institute
Inexpensive natural gas and new North American oil supplies, produced by fracking and other innovative drilling technologies, is reshaping the U.S. energy profile. Though it is bringing short-term benefits, it can poses long-term threats to our economy and environment for our communities. Fortunately, these threats are avoidable, if we act to balance our growing reliance on these fossil fuels with other clean energy sources that we must develop for the long term – biofuels, nuclear and renewables.

Our current energy policy of “All of the Above,” is in reality a different one: “Let Today’s Commodity Prices Rule.” For example, decisions on new electric power generation – which accounts for 65 percent of our industrial, residential and commercial energy use – are based largely on the low price of natural gas today. A decade ago, natural gas fueled less than 8 percent of our electricity. Now its use has increased by more than 170 percent, and it produces over 21 percent of our power. By focusing on near-term commodity pricing, we will block the development and investment of long-term sustainable energy solutions for our communities, particularly our metropolitan areas. 

The Wisconsin Energy Institute is a meta-center structured to harness the energy-related research, teaching and outreach, and industry expertise on the UW-Madison campus. The integrated research, discovery and technology transfer products being developed by WEI will produce an even larger suite of clean energy strategies to diversify how we generate useful energy, store it upon demand, and improve how society distributes, uses and conserves this valuable resource.  The WEI is creating, integrating and transferring knowledge in energy resources, technology and sustainability. Our efforts focus on making breakthroughs in key areas of the energy sector:

>Liquid fuels and transportation systems
Energy storage (thermal and electrical) and utilization
Carbon neutral electricity sources
Policy, economics and societal impact of energy challenges

WEI will provide focus, support, and visibility to the many energy-related education, research and service activities on the UW-Madison campus.  Its mission is to enhance our national leadership by identifying strategies for clean, efficient energy to help assure continued economic growth for the state and the nation. WEI provides a venue for exchanges of ideas on energy issues, integrates and transfer knowledge to understand challenges and needs in energy resources, technology and sustainability. 

###Educational Opportunities and Solutions: 
UW-Madison has the diversity of world-class scholars needed to solve this complicated interdisciplinary problem in disciplines including engineering, climate science, business and economics, policy, sociology.  The Livable Cities Initiative will provide a platform on which these scholars, and the students they mentor, will work in a cross-campus collaborative network unfettered by traditional academic barriers to develop the knowledge necessary to solve this enormously complex set of interconnected problems.

This concept allows the faculty and staff to rethink curriculum in a new, exciting, and innovative way. Capstone certificates, new master's degree programs, and non-credit programs are possible and can leverage our scale and interdisciplinary excellence and strengths in creating frontier and leading programs.  A blend of new interdisciplinary curriculum with state-of-the-art delivery will allow us to energize instruction for UW-Madison undergraduate and graduate students while also reaching a global audience using multiple modalities.  Given the population migration to urban cities, a growing world population, shrinking energy resources, and global warming, among others, there are unlimited opportunities to create educational programs and services that better prepare us for the challenges that are before us.

###International sustainable cities - Ethiopia:
The fastest growing cities are located in Asia and Africa, making these regions particularly important to include in a UW strategy toward Livable Cities.  Here is one case study where UW-Madison already has health and agricultural research collaboration, and how a Livable Cities project might unfold.

The Global Health Institute (GHI) of the University of Wisconsin is working toward a research agenda and partnership planning towards a sustainable cities initiative for Ethiopia, as one example.  As a means of promoting positive urban change in Africa, the city of Hawassa, Ethiopia is an ideal candidate for early intervention and colleagues there are eager to collaborate. 

Leveraging Ethiopia’s stated national priorities of Climate Resilience and a Green Economy (CRGE), our aim is to facilitate the transformation of cities in Ethiopia to be both more sustainable and healthier. With the help of local and national partners in government, academic institutions and business, our team will evaluate and implement approaches in urban design and micro-grid technology that supports equitable, clean, and reliable energy and transportation. The ultimate goal of the project is to create a model for sustainable African cities where the interactions of government, businesses, and science continue to secure the livelihoods of the population as the city grows.  

Our approach to creating a more sustainable future for Africa is designed around an understanding of the connections between cities and the surrounding lands, and recognizes that the two must be considered together as a system to create meaningful and lasting positive change for the entire population. Thus, GHI aims to bring together multiple disciplines and stakeholders at UW-Madison and in Ethiopia to harness the potential for successful development in Africa. To do this we propose to combine the implementation of key technologies, which are proven and deployable, with substantive research that assesses the physical, political, cultural, and economic structures that contribute to their success on a regional and national scale. Our proposal is particularly well positioned for accomplish the specific aims mentioned above because of the depth and breadth of expertise at UW, our existing connections with Ethiopian institutions and communities, and most importantly, because of the desire of Ethiopia to serve as a African and global leader for sustainable development. Our ongoing partnerships with the pilot city of Hawassa and Ethiopia’s position as the seat of the African Union increase the chances of impactful investment stimulating similar transformations throughout Africa and the rest of the world.  

###Funding and Use: 
A transformational gift in support of the Livable Cities Initiative would drive entrepreneurial, cross-cutting, collaborative human capital development.  Held in trust for whole-campus initiatives, the fund would be overseen and directed by the Office of the Chancellor. The fund would be managed to create flexibility and incentives for our best minds to collaborate at unprecedented scale to solve this enormously complex set of interconnected problems. Targeted investments will be used to promote risk-taking, to find complementary collaborators within and between campuses, and to reward research teams for pursuing unorthodox and high-risk projects: a UW Fundamental Challenges Program (FCP).

The essential organizing concept of the FCP is the "prototype solution." The prototype solution is derived from treating the entire University as a dynamic laboratory for exploring ideas in cross-campus, trans-disciplinary teams. To address differing aspects of Prosperous Cities in a rapidly changing world (e.g. weather-ready infrastructure; integrated systems for energy, housing, and water; sustainable economic development; smart transportation; or green arts and culture), small teams will be provided in the form of seed grants to self-assemble to design and implement alternative prototype solutions: scaled-down, flexible solution components (e.g. experimental technologies, social organizations, or art-science collaborations). Successful teams will then be encouraged and supported to form larger collaborative networks aimed at tackling the problem at larger scale, prototyped in situ, with partnering municipalities. 

Funding support for FCP projects will be scaled according to project need and largely unrestricted in its use, but focused on the key tools that can deliver results, including:

**Challenge Professorships**
>These endowed professorships, distributed through competitive proposals, will be advanced in key areas of “connective” expertise. Challenge Professorships would be held by visionary scholars in cross-cutting fields to unite diverse team members and groups.

**Challenge Fellowships**
>These fellowships provide financial and administrative support for a new kind of graduate research, which links the training of scholars in diverse fields (e.g., climate research, urban agriculture, nature writing, restoration ecology, etc.) to communities, companies, and not-for-profit organizations in targeted urban contexts. 

**Challenge Seed Grants**
>These competitively distributed funds would have few restrictions and would be used for salaries, equipment, consulting fees and travel. The resources would support researcher time, collaborator travel, small-scale laboratory seed experiments, and mechanisms for effective reporting. 

>This model matches precisely the core competences of the UW culture. These competences include: (1) a scale advantage derived from almost total disciplinary coverage, (2) horizontal flexibility of faculty, (3) a history of interdisciplinary research through centers, (4) an almost unbeaten track record in highly effective funding for basic research, and (5) an extraordinary history of producing students of high quality in an inclusive and large-scale setting. 

>But it further addresses a fundamental barrier to revolutionary innovation, the high transaction costs associated with bridging the knowledge communities across campus to produce deliverables on a fast time-scale. The Fundamental Challenge Program is a mechanism, in short, to change the nature of higher education itself, and propel the University of Wisconsin toward imagining and prototyping the prosperous cities of the future.
